<h2><B>1.1 Test Planing</B></h2>

<p>The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing from the OrangeHRM application.
The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan.<BR>
  
<B>1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated</B><br>
<B>1.1.2 Entry criteria defined</B><br>
<B>1.1.3 Exit criteria defined</B><br>
<B>1.1.4 Test scope:</B><br>
<ul>
<li>Tests in scope:</li>
<li>Tests not in scope:</li>

<b><h2>1.4 Test Design</h2></b>

<p>Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. For the test case creation process, I used the following test design techniques:
<ul>
<li>Equivalence class partitioning</li>
<li>Boundary value analysis</li>
<li>Decision table-based testing</li>
<li>State transition</li></ul>
I also use our expertise in creating test cases by applying the below test techniques which will not be covered by test cases and which will serve as a quick way to obtain results:  
<ul>
  <li>Error guessing</li>
  <li>Exploratory testing</li></ul>
  The test cases with steps can be viewed [here](https://github.com/CristinaSipos/Testing-Orange-HRM-Application-using-Jira/files/12283962/Test.cases.docx)

 <b><h2>1.5 Test Implementation</h2></b>

 <p>The following elements are needed before the test execution phase begins:
 <ul>
 <li>Network setup</li>
 <li>Setup of different browsers</li>
 <li>Application testing environment: OrangeHRM</li>
 <li>User and password</li>
 <li>Database of employees</li>
 <li>Jira, Zephyr access</li>
 </ul></p>
 <p>
 <b><h2>1.6 Test Execution</h2></b>
 <ul>
 <li>Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary:</li>
 <li>Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found here:</li>
 </ul></p>
<p>  
<b><h2>1.7 Test Completion</h2></b>
<ul>
<li>Exit criteria were evaluated and passed</li>
<li>The traceability matrix was generated and can be found here:</li>
<li>Test execution chart was generated, the final report shows.... </li>
</ul>
