<b><h2>Functional specifications</h2><b>
<h2><B>1.1 Test Planing</B></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/CristinaSipos/Testing-Orange-HRM-Application-using-Jira/files/12314915/Test.plan.docx.pdf">Test Plan</a> is designed to describe all details of testing from the OrangeHRM application.
The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan.<BR>
  
<B>1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated</B><br>
<ul>
  <li>Project Manager: Radulescu Gabriela</li>
  <li>Software Tester: Sipos Cristina</li> 
</ul>
<B>1.1.2 Entry criteria defined</B><br>
<ul>
  <li>Complete or partially testable code is available</li>
  <li>Requirements are defined and approved</li>
  <li>Deadlines are established</li>
  <li>Roles and responsibilities are assigned</li>
</ul>
<B>1.1.3 Exit criteria defined</B><br>
<ul>
  <li>Deadlines meet or budget depleted</li>
  <li>Execution and updating of all test cases</li>
  <li>Desired and sufficient coverage of the requirements and functionalities under the test</li>
  <li>All the identified defects are corrected and closed</li>
  <li>No high priority or severity or critical bug has been left out</li>
  <li>98% of test cases must be executed and passed</li>
  <li>98% of Medium severity defects have been closed</li>
</ul>

<B>1.1.4 Test scope</B><br>
<ul>
<li>Tests in scope:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Admin Module</li>
    <li>PIM Module</li>
    <li>Leave Module</li>
    <li>Time Module</li>
    <li>Recruitment Module</li>
    <li>Performance Module</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Tests not in scope:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-functional testing like stress, and performance is beyond the scope of this project</li>
    <li>No QA support for mobile application developed. Only web application will be tested</li>
    <li>Automation testing is beyond scope</li>
</ul>

  
<B>1.1.5 Risks detected:</B>
<ul>
  <li>Project risks:</li>
     <ul>
       <li>Testing schedule is tight</li>
       <li>Not enough resources</li>
       <li>Defects are found at a late stage of the cycle</li>
       <li>Lack of experience of the QA team</li>
       <li>Delay in delivery of test cases</li>
       <li>Changes to the original requirements or designs</li>
     </ul>
  <li>Product risks:</li>
</ul>

<B>1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria</B>
<p>The entry criteria defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.</p>


<h2><B>1.2 Test Monitoring and Control</B></h2>

![Test monitoring and control](https://github.com/CristinaSipos/Testing-Orange-HRM-Application-using-Jira/assets/116946193/e3f81d4d-93dd-4db8-b7d8-cbb42da9e52f)

<b><H2>1.3 Test Analysis</H2></b>
<p>During this phase the testing team will analyze the requirements and will create the test conditions that will serve as a guide for the functionalities to be tested.
The requirements analysis results will be documented here.</p>

<b><h2>1.4 Test Design</h2></b>

<p>Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. For the test case creation process, I used the following test design techniques:
<ul>
<li>Equivalence class partitioning</li>
<li>Boundary value analysis</li>
<li>Decision table-based testing</li>
<li>State transition</li></ul>
I also use our expertise in creating test cases by applying the below test techniques which will not be covered by test cases and which will serve as a quick way to obtain results:  
<ul>
  <li>Error guessing</li>
  <li>Exploratory testing</li></ul>
  The test cases with steps can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/CristinaSipos/Testing-Orange-HRM-Application-using-Jira/files/12289980/Test.case.docx">here.</a>.
   </p>
 <b><h2>1.5 Test Implementation</h2></b>

 <p>The following elements are needed before the test execution phase begins:
 <ul>
 <li>Network setup</li>
 <li>Setup of different browsers</li>
 <li>Application testing environment: OrangeHRM</li>
 <li>User and password</li>
 <li>Database of employees</li>
 <li>Jira, Zephyr access</li>
 </ul></p>
 <p>
 <b><h2>1.6 Test Execution</h2></b>
 <ul>
 <li>Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary:</li>
 <li>Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found <a href="https://github.com/CristinaSipos/Testing-Orange-HRM-Application-using-Jira/files/12362383/Bug-word.docx">here</a>
</li>
 </ul></p>
<p>  
<b><h2>1.7 Test Completion</h2></b>
<ul>
<li>Exit criteria were evaluated and passed</li>
<li>The traceability matrix was generated and can be found here:</li>
<li>Test execution chart was generated, the final report shows.... </li>
</ul>
