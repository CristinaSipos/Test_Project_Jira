<h2>Functional specifications</h2>
<h2>1.1 Test Planing</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/CristinaSipos/Testing-Orange-HRM-Application-using-Jira/files/12314915/Test.plan.docx.pdf">Test Plan</a> is designed to describe all details of testing from the OrangeHRM application.
The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan.<BR>

<h4>1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria</h4>
<p>The entry criteria defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.</p>


<h2>1.2 Test Monitoring and Control</h2>
<p>Below is the progress of the project displaying daily test execution progress: passed, failed, and blocked tests.
</p>

<h2>1.3 Test Analysis</h2>
<p>During this phase the testing team analyzed the requirements and created the test conditions that served as a guide for the functionalities to be tested.
The requirements analysis results were documented <a href="https://github.com/CristinaSipos/Testing-Orange-HRM-Application-using-Jira/files/12362691/Informal.review.docx">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>1.4 Test Design</h2>

<p>Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. For the test case creation process, I used the following test design techniques:
<ul>
<li>Equivalence class partitioning</li>
<li>Boundary value analysis</li>
<li>Decision table-based testing</li>
<li>State transition testing</li></ul>
<br>
I also used  expertise in creating test cases by applying the below test techniques which were not be covered by test cases and which served as a quick way to obtain results:  
<ul>
  <li>Error guessing</li>
  <li>Exploratory testing</li></ul>
  The test cases with steps can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/CristinaSipos/Testing-Orange-HRM-Application-using-Jira/files/12289980/Test.case.docx">here</a>.
   </p>
 <h2>1.5 Test Implementation</h2>

 <p>The following elements were needed before the test execution phase began:
 <ul>
 <li>Network setup</li> 
 <li>Setup of different browsers</li>
 <li>Application testing environment: OrangeHRM</li>
 <li>User and password</li>
 <li>Database of employees</li>
 <li>Jira, Zephyr access</li>
 </ul></p>
 <p>
   
 <h2>1.6 Test Execution</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>Test cases were executed on the created test <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aZjPG9nPN87iyWs1EQZF6ReuiVAlj12g"> Cycle summary</a>. </li>
 <li>Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found <a href="https://github.com/CristinaSipos/Testing-Orange-HRM-Application-using-Jira/files/12362383/Bug-word.docx">here</a>.
</li>
 </ul></p>
 
<h2>1.7 Test Completion</h2>

The purpose of testing the Orange HRM application was for training and for developing my testing skills. My testing is reasonably complete for the purposes of fulfilling my mission. My primary mission was to cover testing of the five modules of the application: Admin, PIM, Leave, Time, and Recruitment. The testing process was a highly exploratory process because I was in the process of learning the product as I went.</li>
